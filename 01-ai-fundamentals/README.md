# AI Fundamentals for ERC-8004 Agents

## Why Start Here?

Before building trustless agents on Ethereum, you need to understand **what AI agents are** and how they work. This section covers the basics of AI agents, LLMs, and multi-agent systems.

**No prior AI experience required** - everything explained from scratch!

## What You'll Learn

1. **What are LLMs?** - The "brain" that powers AI agents
2. **Multi-Agent Systems** - How agents work together as a team
3. **CrewAI Framework** - Practical framework for building agents
4. **Tools & Structured Output** - How agents interact with code and data

## Prerequisites

- Basic programming knowledge (Python helpful but not required)
- Understanding that AI agents are more than simple bots

## Reading Order
